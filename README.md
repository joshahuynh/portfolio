Challenge 2: Portfolio

In this challenge, I used HTML and CSS to add my personal work, profile picture, about me, and all of my contact-info/social medias.
The website includes direct links to my work, as well as direct links to contact me.
It is also responsive to all size screens, allowing it to be viewed on any device.

User story: As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples,
so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

Acceptance criteria: GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
When I load their portfolio, then I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
When I click one of the links in the navigation then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
When I click on the link to the section about their work, then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
When I am presented with the developer's first application, then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
When I click on the images of the applications, then I am taken to that deployed application.
When I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, then I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport mock-up.
